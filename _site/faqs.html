      <h1 id="faqs">FAQs</h1>

<h4 id="what-are-we-trying-to-do">What are we trying to do?</h4>
<p>We are trying to get the Nuclear Weapons Free Berkeley Act on the City of Berkeley ballot for
2018 or 2020.</p>

<h4 id="what-does-this-proposed-measure-do">What does this proposed measure do?</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Revises the 1986 Berkeley Nuclear Free Act.</li>
  <li>Advocates for the elimination of nuclear weapons worldwide by August 6, 2045 (the 100-year anniversary of dropping a nuclear weapon on the Japanese city of Hiroshima).</li>
  <li>Advocates for a freeze on the modernization of nuclear weapons.</li>
  <li>Advocates for the elimination in the stockpile of non-deployed nuclear weapons, and for a plan to phase out all nuclear weapons by 2045.</li>
  <li>Opposes nuclear weapons by banning work for nuclear weapons within the City of Berkeley.</li>
  <li>Advocates that federal government funding of nuclear weapons be repurposed toward combating climate change and towards helping develop and expand carbon-free energy resources.</li>
  <li>Prevents the spread of nuclear weapons by promoting non-proliferation efforts.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="why-should-we-update-the-berkeley-nuclear-free-act">Why should we update the Berkeley Nuclear Free Act?</h4>
<p>The current law advocates for just halting the production of nuclear weapons. This was the only logical argument that could be made with 60,000 weapons globally. However, now that number less than 15,000 and shrinking. It is now more feasible to eliminate nuclear weapons altogether. The new measure would also advocate for federal funding to combat climate change. It promotes non-proliferation research and eases restrictions on the City of Berkeley’s contracts with UC Berkeley and LBNL. This means more collaboration on important topics such as climate change mitigation research. The current law uses outdated information and needs to be updated.</p>

<h4 id="are-there-any-financial-benefits-for-the-city-by-changing-this-law">Are there any financial benefits for the city by changing this law?</h4>
<p>Yes!  There are multiple unneccessary contract and investment restrictions by the current law.  Some interpretations of the law says that the City of Berkeley cannot invest in US Treasury bonds.  The current law also makes it harder to collaborate with UC Berkeley and Lawerence Berkeley National Lab. It has even caused issues with the Berkeley Public Library doing business with 3M, one of the largest office supply companies in the world.  More information can be found in this article: <a href="http://www.berkeleyside.com/2011/10/11/can-berkeley-live-with-not-being-nuclear-free/">Can Berkeley Live with Not Being Nuclear Free?</a>
The new law will ease these restrictions, which will save the City time and taxpayer money, while making sure the City of Berkeley does not invest directly in nuclear weapons work.</p>
